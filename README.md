# NBA stats per game scraper

[Basketball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/) is one of the best site for basketball stats but it's not super easy to scrape: with this code you can scrape from it the stats of all the games played on a particular date given in input.

The command line sintax is:
```
python3 Main.py DAY/MONTH/YEAR
```

where DAY/MONTH/YEAR is the date from which you want to scrape games stats.
